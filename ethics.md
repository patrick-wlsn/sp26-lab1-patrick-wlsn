## (Answer before group discussion) Scoring System Rationale  

What are your housing priority scoring criteria? Why did you choose these weights? How do they reflect the goals of fairness, privacy, simplicity, or rewarding effort? Recall that the categories are:

- Class year (1=Freshman, 2=Sophomore, 3=Junior, 4=Senior)
- Graduation status (True/False)
- Credits earned
- Additional questions - what questions did you choose?

Describe your thought process here before the group discussion.





## (Answer after group discussion) Similarities and Differences

1. Describe how your scoring system is similar to at least one other system. If there are none like yours, explain why.
2. Describe how your scoring system is different from at least one other system. If everyone in your group had the same system, please state that (after checking carefully that there really are no differences).
